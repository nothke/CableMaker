CableMaker
==========
by Ivan Notaro≈° - Nothke
for Unity

Description:
  This script will create a model of a hanging cable between 2 points. 
  The cable is a STATIC object that is created at start and is not meant to change during runtime. (although it can be, by calling ReDraw())
  It is simply just used to help create a hanging cable model quickly.
  
Check the file comments for how to use it
